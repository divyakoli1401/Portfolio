        <p>This blog is for the appreciation of those mundane aspects of life that often are overlooked, like the
            beautiful
            seasons that we get to experience and live. One of those seasons is winter. For some strange reason I always
            loved winters. Those long cold winter nights made me feel mystified yet there was something magical about
            them.
            The foggy early mornings, cold winter breez running through my face, me getting late for my college wearing
            my
            favorite hoodies. Putting my hands in my pockets struggling to find the slightest amount of heat to save
            them
            from getting cold..</p>
        <p>
            I've always struggled with perpetual cold hands and feet since I was a child, but still I
            always loved the cold weather during Winters. I can't quite describe the feeling in words but if I had to
            assign some
            word to it, it'll probably be tranquility, the sense of calmness and peacefulness that winter renders being
            the
            cold stern season it is, in itself is unreal. Sipping a cup of hot tea sitting in college canteen, in the
            cold
            weather is heavenly. I always felt that rainy season was overrated. Rains are so passé for being known as
            romantic. The real romance lies in the winter nights. And obviously the best part about winters is the
            Holiday
            season✨
